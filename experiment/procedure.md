<h2>Procedure:</h2>
<p>
  The simulation will start to play on clicking the 'Power On' button. Now the string starts vibrating. Adjust the knife edges or the magnet to get the maximum vibration. At maximum vibration, the paper rider placed on the string will fall down. Repeat the same for different weight, radius, string material, and environment. Use the Reset button to reset the simulation.

<h2>Procedurefor real lab:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Set up the sonometer on a stable bench with the wire stretched between two fixed bridges.</li>
  <li>Place the knife edges (or bridges) at a suitable distance apart. This is the initial vibrating length <strong>L</strong>.</li>
  <li>Hang known weights on the pulley attached to the end of the wire to apply tension. Note the total mass and calculate the tension <strong>T = mg</strong>.</li>
  <li>Place a small paper rider (small folded paper) on the middle of the vibrating length.</li>
  <li>Strike a tuning fork of known frequency and place its stem on the sonometer box to transfer vibrations to the wire.</li>
  <li>Adjust the length <strong>L</strong> by sliding the knife edges until maximum vibration is observed (the paper rider jumps or falls off). This indicates resonance.</li>
  <li>Measure the resonating length using a meter scale. Repeat for different tuning fork frequencies while keeping the tension constant.</li>
  <li>Repeat the steps for other weights to see the effect of tension if required.</li>
  <li>Record observations of length and corresponding frequencies.</li>
</ol>
