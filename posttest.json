      "question": "A wire under tension vibrates with a frequency of 450 per second. What would be the fundamental frequency if the wire were half as long, twice as thick and under one-fourth tension?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "247 Hz",
        "b": "190 Hz",
        "c": "174 Hz",
        "d": "225 Hz"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Recalculate using frequency formula considering radius and tension.",
        "b": "Close, but not exact. Review √T and μ ∝ r² effect.",
        "c": "Correct. Accounts for all changes in string length, radius, and tension.",
        "d": "Not the right value. Double-check units and square root factors."

      "question": "The equation of transverse wave in a string is: y = 8 sin [1.256x - 25.12t] cm. What is the amplitude of the wave?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "1.256 cm",
        "b": "0.0208 m",
        "c": "8 cm",
        "d": "25.12 cm"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. That's the wave number.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Unit mismatch.",
        "c": "Correct. Amplitude is the coefficient before sine.",
        "d": "Incorrect. That’s angular frequency."

      "answers": {
        "a": "Seebeck effect",

        "c": "Thomson effect",
        "d": "Joules effect"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Seebeck effect governs thermo emf generation.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Peltier relates to heat at junctions, not emf.",
        "c": "Related but not the primary cause of thermo emf.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Joule effect relates to heat due to current."
