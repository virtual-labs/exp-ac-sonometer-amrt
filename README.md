### About the Experiment 

Every object has a natural frequency of vibration. If kinetic energy is applied to an object at a rate that matches its natural frequency, resonance occurs and the object vibrates. In this experiment, a small alternating current, produced by a signal generator, causes an electromagnet to exert a periodic force on a wire stretched over a sonometer box. When the frequency of the applied current matches the natural frequency of the wire segment, resonance occurs, producing maximum vibration.
